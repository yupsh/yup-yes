# yes is an infinite stream, so every comparison is capped with `head -n N` on
# BOTH sides to terminate. parity holds for the no-operand and single-operand
# forms; the multi-operand join and the -n/--count limit are yup-yes extensions
# with no GNU equivalent, asserted exactly (see cmd-yes COMPATIBILITY.md).
#
# parity CASE  — `yup-yes CASE | head -n N` must equal `yes CASE | head -n N`.
# assert WANT  — yup-yes must produce WANT exactly (documented divergences).
